"simsam" is a user-written package for Stata, which calculates the sample size needed to achieve
given statistical power, for any analysis that can be programmed, using simulation. It does this
efficiently and precisely, without the need to specify a range of possible sample sizes and
check the power for each one.

If you have Stata and want to install simsam, type the command "findit simsam" in Stata, and
click on the "install" link.

The package is described further in an article in the Stata Journal:

This GitHub archive contains the Stata code for simsam that may be saved as a Stata "ado" file, 
the text of the Stata help file, and two slide presentations on using simsam.
